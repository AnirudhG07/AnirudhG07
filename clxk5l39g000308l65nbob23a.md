Have you ever wondered how ethical hacking works? How cyber security people become who they are? That's still a long distance road but what about, how do you find exploits in softwares and programs which cyber attackers(hackers, bad guys) find just by analysing it, even after so much Security Testings done to it.

What if I could try implementing those, reverse enginerring, web exploitation, etc. but in a small scale? Well CTF is your answer.

# CTF? What's that?

'Capture The Flag' is like a digital treasure hunt in which players would face challenges related to finding hidden flags in cybersecurity challenges. It is a great way to hone your skills in the fields such as hacking, cybersecurity, reverse engineering, binary and web exploitations and many more related topics.

So how do we play it? Well in simple words-

* You get a problem statement
    
* You look around the machine/code given to you
    
* You try to find vulnerabilities you can exploit
    
* You get the flag of some format, like CTF{some\_text\_1234}
    

That's it! But that's the illusion, the hardest part is to find the vulnerability, and that's the whole game. You may need to create your own codes to crack the problem, think of unthinkable ideas to implement(basically see the solution), brute force you way in, use neat tricks and what not. All this comes from experience and practise.

# CTF practising is amazing

Practising CTF is something very refreshing and side by side super irritating. The satisfaction of getting a flag is equally frustrating when you can't figure it out. But that's what drives you, the satisfaction and hunger to learn the method to solve.

In my experience, I learnt so much about Terminal, shell scripting, usages of cookies, about assembly and computer architecture and what not. These gives you lots of experience, making you better and better at CTF.

Here are some tips you can do while practising CTF-

* Maintain your own repository where you store all tricks, tips, commands, Payloads, etc. to use. This helps you look for exploits which you may not be able to think on the spot.
    
* Don't give up. Read the code properly. Try all possibilities which comes to your head and your repo shows you.
    
* Think outside the box. See the exploits you can try based on the language the code is written. For example, `strcmp` has vulnerability when compared to empty array `[]`, C language has finite numbers hence overflow can be used as an exploit.
    
* Get comfortable with the tools that you are using. Knowing what your weapon does comes in handy. You never know the solution shows another usage of your favuorite tool

There are various benifits of practising CTF apart from what I just told. These are -

1. **Enhances problem-solving skills:** CTFs challenge participants to think creatively and analytically, improving their ability to solve complex problems.
    
2. **Improves understanding of cybersecurity concepts:** Practicing CTFs help in gaining a deeper understanding of various cybersecurity principles and techniques.
    
3. **Builds experience with real-world tools and technologies:** Participants often encounter a wide range of tools and technologies during CTFs, providing valuable hands-on experience.
    
4. **Develops teamwork and communication skills:** Many CTF challenges require collaboration, fostering teamwork and effective communication among team members.
    
5. **Prepares for career opportunities:** Competing in CTFs can make candidates more attractive to employers in the cybersecurity field by demonstrating their practical skills and passion for security.
    

To learn abour CTF's, you must have resources to read and competitions to try on. Most of the experience and knowledge you gain is from practising only. Having initial knowledge of languages, computer architure, servers and pentesting, etc. always helps.

# Resources & Competition

# Writeups

When you are practising CTF and not in a competition, you may wanna see a solution to the problem since you can't solve it. And hence, there exists kind spirits who write their solutions with pictures and walkthroughs, which is called `"writeup"` of a CTF.

There are various websites, github repositories, youtube videos, discord channels, etc. maintained by people which have Writeups of various problems from websites, competitions and other sources.

You should read multiple of them since not everyone finds the same solution. Now that you have given up on the problem, better to gain more knowledge as a student than see a solution and be done with it. That's called cheating then not seeing a solution and learning from it. It's all about "your" intentions and not what you show the world.
